Description: Simulates time-to-event data
    with type I right censoring using two methods: the inverse CDF
    method and our proposed memoryless method. The latter method
    takes advantage of the memoryless property of survival and
    simulates a separate distribution between change-points. We
    include two parametric distributions: exponential and Weibull.
    Inverse CDF method draws on the work of Rainer Walke (2010),
